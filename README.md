# Initial-Margin-modeling-FHS-VaR-Delta-Normal-VaR-
This project contains two ways of modeling VaR: Filter Historical Simulation VaR and Delta Normal Method. They both based on the background of modeling Initial Margin.

For the Delta Normal Method, I replicated the paper: Shi, M., Yu, X., & Zhang, K. (2018). Initial margin with risky collateral. Journal of Risk, 20(3), 49â€“68. https://doi.org/10.21314/JOR.2018.377. The result is consistent.
